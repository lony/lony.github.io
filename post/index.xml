      <description>Starting May 25th, 2018 the new General Data Protection Regulation will become effective. In German &amp;ldquo;Datenschutz-Grundverordnung&amp;rdquo; this new legislation will align and harmonise European privacy laws and is already known for its high fees. Most prominent areas covered are the following and should be carefully considered to comply.
 Accountability
 Principle of data economy Appropriation Data integrity Data safety Breach notification  Access
 Reservation of authorisation Right to be forgotten Data portability   Is this THE red flag act for European IT or the game changer to have a unique, competitive advantage?</description>

      <description>Last year I tried to &amp;ldquo;semi-automate&amp;rdquo; my OSX setup, as described in the Mac OS X Setup post. This weekend I enhanced the deployment using Ansible.
If you are interested have a look into my dotfile repository. The setup for now only supports OSX, but is already a big step forward for me.
Usage  Clone repo git clone git@github.com:lony/dotFiles.git Customize all_secret.sh and maybe .ssh/config (see SSH guide) Execute .</description>

      <description>This German election is the first time since World War II that a racist and history revisionist party is elected into the German Bundestag - our Congress.
Looking at the predications from SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung just 2 pm on election day (UTC+1) the predictions show a 10+ % yield for the AfD, easily reaching the 5 % threshold for entry.
(Source: www.sueddeutsche.de &amp;ldquo;Wahlzentrale&amp;rdquo; from 2017-09-24 14:00 UTC+1)
5.316.095 people made the AfD their first choice and 5.</description>

      <description>Working with web applications every day, a lot of my time is spend troubleshooting problems with them. In this post I write what I learned about debugging web applications in production, and during testing. Using the famous OSI layers, I try to navigate through all the important parts someone should look at.
As things change I constantly update this post and adjust it. If you find a bug or want to recommend something, please feel free to open an issue and help me get better.</description>

      <description>This list was started in search for the right architecture to develop a cross-platform tool, which I needed badly for myself. As I&amp;rsquo;m working private and commercially with the tool, I need support for all three mayor operating systems Linux, Windows and OS X.
First of all there is always a Wikipedia list around. Next I then started by researching how tools I liked are developed. I looked for my favorite apps and how they are build for example the all famous Sublime Text editor, which is developed in C++ as stated here.</description>

      <description>Working with UNIX systems you often need commands to get something done. This is a continuously updated collection of useful commands I compile and maintain for myself - and maybe also for you.
The collection is divided into different sections under which the commands are explained. For each commands there are examples how to use them, as links - from which information about the command can be gathered. For the most commands there is also a short explanation what it does.</description>

      <description>Working as a client I got to know Michael Muckel. He is a head of software division at a company I consulted.
One day we worked with an open source tool and he stated:
 We should give something back after using so many open source tools.
 That&amp;rsquo;s basically why I started this blog.
Over the years learning computer science, private as professionally I used a lot of public information.</description>
