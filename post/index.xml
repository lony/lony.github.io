      <description>Working with web applications every day, a lot of my time is spend troubleshooting problems with them. In this post I write what I learned about debugging web applications in production, and during testing. Using the famous OSI layers, I try to navigate through all the important parts someone should look at.
As things change I constantly update this post and adjust it. If you find a bug or want to recommend something, please feel free to open an issue and help me get better.</description>

      <description>This list was started in search for the right architecture to develop a cross-platform tool, which I needed badly for myself. As I&amp;rsquo;m working private and commercially with the tool, I need support for all three mayor operating systems Linux, Windows and OS X.
First of all there is always a Wikipedia list around. Next I then started by researching how tools I liked are developed. I looked for my favorite apps and how they are build for example the all famous Sublime Text editor, which is developed in C++ as stated here.</description>

      <description>Working with UNIX systems you often need commands to get something done. This is a continuously updated collection of useful commands I compile and maintain for myself - and maybe also for you.
The collection is divided into different sections under which the commands are explained. For each commands there are examples how to use them, as links - from which information about the command can be gathered. For the most commands there is also a short explanation what it does.</description>

      <description>Working as a client I got to know Michael Muckel. He is a head of software division at a company I consulted.
One day we worked with an open source tool and he stated:
 We should give something back after using so many open source tools.
 That&amp;rsquo;s basically why I started this blog.
Over the years learning computer science, private as professionally I used a lot of public information.</description>
