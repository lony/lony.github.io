      <description>This list was started in search for the right architecture to develop a cross-platform tool, which I needed badly for myself. As I&amp;rsquo;m working private and commercially with the tool, I need support for all three mayor operating systems Linux, Windows and OS X.
First of all there is always a Wikipedia list around. Next I then started by researching how tools I liked are developed. I looked for my favorite apps and how they are build for example the all famous Sublime Text editor, which is developed in C++ as stated here.</description>
