      <description>IPv6 is the replacement version of the existing IPv4 protocol version for transmitting packages on the internet. Its most visible change is the change of 32-bit addresses to 64-bit, which you can notice having characters on top of the already used numbers.
The transition is happening slowly. Looking at a statistic compiled by Google so far only ~25% of the global internet is able to use IPv6.
Still as you may plan to select your new internet service provider (ISP) there are some things to consider about IPv6.</description>

      <description>Working with web applications every day, a lot of my time is spend troubleshooting problems with them. In this post I write what I learned about debugging web applications in production, and during testing. Using the famous OSI layers, I try to navigate through all the important parts someone should look at.
Update 2018-02-18 If you are interest in the details of how the internet is working I highly recommend you the following amazing Ars Technica article &amp;ldquo;How the Internet works: Submarine fiber, brains in jars, and coaxial cables&amp;rdquo;.</description>
