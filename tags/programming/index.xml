      <description>Virtualization was standard when Docker came around 2013 and made containerization the new state of the art. This new ecosystem shifted the landscape and was under heavy development, which today we want to make a snapshot of. This post should not only cover Docker but software abstraction in general.
As things change I constantly update this post and adjust it. If you find a bug or want to recommend something, please feel free to open an issue and help me get better.</description>

      <description>Last year I tried to &amp;ldquo;semi-automate&amp;rdquo; my OSX setup, as described in the Mac OS X Setup post. This weekend I enhanced the deployment using Ansible.
If you are interested have a look into my dotfile repository. The setup for now only supports OSX, but is already a big step forward for me.
Usage  Clone repo git clone git@github.com:lony/dotFiles.git Customize all_secret.sh and maybe .ssh/config (see SSH guide) Execute .</description>

      <description>Working with web applications every day, a lot of my time is spend troubleshooting problems with them. In this post I write what I learned about debugging web applications in production, and during testing. Using the famous OSI layers, I try to navigate through all the important parts someone should look at.

      <description>This list was started in search for the right architecture to develop a cross-platform tool, which I needed badly for myself. As I&amp;rsquo;m working private and commercially with the tool, I need support for all three mayor operating systems Linux, Windows and OS X.
First of all there is always a Wikipedia list around. Next I then started by researching how tools I liked are developed. I looked for my favorite apps and how they are build for example the all famous Sublime Text editor, which is developed in C++ as stated here.</description>

      <description>Working with UNIX systems you often need commands to get something done. This is a continuously updated collection of useful commands I compile and maintain for myself - and maybe also for you.
The collection is divided into different sections under which the commands are explained. For each commands there are examples how to use them, as links - from which information about the command can be gathered. For the most commands there is also a short explanation what it does.</description>
