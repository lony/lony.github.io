      <description>Working with UNIX systems you often need commands to get something done. This is a continuously updated collection of useful commands I compile and maintain for myself - and maybe also for you.
The collection is divided into different sections under which the commands are explained. For each commands there are examples how to use them, as links - from which information about the command can be gathered. For the most commands there is also a short explanation what it does.</description>
