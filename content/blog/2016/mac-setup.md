This post contains information about how I tweak a new Mac when I first get it. As things change I constantly update this post and adjust it. If you find a bug or want to recommend something, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/lony/lony.github.io/issues) and help me get better. - Thank you!

# User interface

Following the [defaults-write.com instructions](http://www.defaults-write.com/10-terminal-commands-to-speed-up-your-mac-in-os-x-el-capitan/) I first try to optimize the UX experience of OSX.

To apply the following changes you have to reboot your machine. To undo use `defaults delete NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat`.

* Disable animations when opening and closing windows: `defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSAutomaticWindowAnimationsEnabled -bool false`
* Disable animations when opening a Quick Look window: `defaults write -g QLPanelAnimationDuration -float 0`
* Accelerated playback when adjusting the window size (Cocoa applications): `defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSWindowResizeTime -float 0.001`
* Disable animation when opening the Info window in OS X Finder (cmdâŒ˜ + i): `defaults write com.apple.finder DisableAllAnimations -bool true`
* Disable animations when you open an application from the Dock: `defaults write com.apple.dock launchanim -bool false`
* Make all animations faster that are used by Mission Control: `defaults write com.apple.dock expose-animation-duration -float 0.1`
* Disable the delay when you hide the Dock: `defaults write com.apple.Dock autohide-delay -float 0`
* The keyboard react faster to keystrokes: `defaults write NSGlobalDomain KeyRepeat -int 0`
* To change the screenshot format to jpg `defaults write com.apple.screencapture type jpg`

After applying this configuration changes through the terminal there are also some adjustments made via the settings interface. I extracted two of them from the following [OSXDaily guide](http://osxdaily.com/2014/10/24/speed-up-os-x-yosemite-mac/).

* System Preferences > Accessibility > Display and there check `Reduce Transparency`
* System Preferences > Dock select `Scale effect` for Minimize windows using

Another really important UX improvement is allowing Finder to show hidden files. To enable this feature type the following into your terminal `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES` [1](https://ianlunn.co.uk/articles/quickly-showhide-hidden-files-mac-os-x-mavericks/)

# Terminal

To prepare for development I first install a couple of tools. As OS X has no package manager I first install - [homebrew](http://brew.sh/index.html) the (missing) package manager.

After the package manager is working I use it to install a bunch of packages for ease of use, as development, as also preparation for incidents e.g. network analysis.

I also set the stage for my [dotFiles](https://github.com/lony/dotFiles), which need some perquisites to work. As there development is currently ongoing, the way to use them is described [here](https://github.com/lony/dotFiles/blob/master/README.md) only.

The first thing my dotFiles need are GNU tools. As OS X is a BSD successor, the default tools are all from the BSD project and if you use Linux often, some things are different. The way to change that is stolen from [this guide](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/first-10-things-new-mac/), and maybe a good read for you too!

The following snipped let you dive into the details of the installation process. Enjoy.

The packages that I normally not install by default, but still like or want to look into are listed in the `brew_packages_consider` array. For you they may be interesting, please feel free to also install them by default.

## Python

If for any reason, you also need a running python installation on your Mac, this is how I install it following the [Hitchhiker's guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/). This will setup a separate installation and should keep your existing python intact. Still everything you open a shell your newly installed python should be referenced.

1. Install gcc

    * Downloading the Command Line Tools from [here](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/) (requires Apple-Account). The file you need is called `Command_Line_Tools_OS_X_10.XX_for_Xcode_7.2.dmg`. *The XX depends on your OSX-Version.*
    * Then install the downloaded dmg

2. Execute `brew install python python3`

If you like you can create Python 3 symbolic links on your system using `brew linkapps python3`, check it afterwards `which python3`.

### OpenCV

Following the guide from [pyimagesearch.com](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/12/19/install-opencv-3-on-macos-with-homebrew-the-easy-way/), I install OpenCV 3 using homebrew.

```
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install opencv3 --with--contrib --with-python3 --with-ffmpeg --with-tbb
# If you wan to see all option use: brew info opencv3
# Maybe also required to find the libs: brew force link --force opencv3
```

## SDKMan

If you plan to develop on the [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) you need an SKD for the language of your choice.

[SDKMan](http://sdkman.io) is a wrapper like rbenv or nvm which allows you to install SDK's as also selecting them for usage.

Sadly there is no brew package available, and you can only install it with the following command: `curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash`

# Apps

Having all the necessities for command line life at the pipe, now is the time for applications. Homebrew wouldn't be THE missing package manager if it could not install also binary packages. Still, to do this there is another tap required - [homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) a homebrew extension for GUI and binary applications.

The following snipped - as before - installs all packages together. The comments should help me understand for what the package was and were to look if there are questions.

```

# Prepare array of cask packages

)

# Install cask packages
brew cask install "${brew_cask_packages[@]}"
```

Now you should have not only cli tools installed but also all your favorite binary tools running. Some more bare then others, but still its close to done!

## iTerm2

To make your favorite terminal emulator a bit more fantastic as it already is, you can adjust the following settings.

* To let iTerm2 fill the complete screen after a resize: Turn on `Preferences> Advanced> Terminal windows resize smoothly`


# Shortcuts

As with every other operating system, also Mac OS has some nice shortcuts which ease the usage of the system.

The most complete list of available shortcuts is provided by Apple on its support [page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236).

The following list is a subset of my personal selection:

| Shortcut         | Usage                  |
|------------------|------------------------|
| âŒ˜ + Tab          | Switch between apps    |
| â‡§ + âŒ˜ + ~        | Switch between windows |
