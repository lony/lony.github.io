Starting May 25th, 2018 the new [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) will become effective. In German "Datenschutz-Grundverordnung" this new legislation will align and harmonise European privacy laws and is already known for its high fees. Most prominent areas covered are the following and should be carefully considered to comply. 

* Accountability

    * Principle of data economy
    * Appropriation
    * Data integrity
    * Data safety
    * Breach notification

* Access

    * Reservation of authorisation
    * Right to be forgotten
    * Data portability

Is this THE [red flag act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive_Acts) for European IT or the game changer to have a unique, competitive advantage?
