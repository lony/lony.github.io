Working as a client I got to know [Michael Muckel](https://github.com/codeofzen). He is a head of software division at a company I consulted.

One day we worked with an open source tool and he stated:

> We should give something back after using so many open source tools.

That's basically why I started this blog.

Over the years learning computer science, private as professionally I used a lot of public information.

Today I want to start giving back some of my findings as well!
